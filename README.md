## TODO

- [ ] Cover URL error handling (HTTP request failed)
- [ ] Improve lazy loading of fetching books
- [ ] Find a good solution for constant and impredictable IP changes in Library Genesis (see /home/manuel/development/libgen_mobile_app/flutter_app/libgen/android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml)
